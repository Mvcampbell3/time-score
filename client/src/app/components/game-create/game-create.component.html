        <p class="content">Making a new game is fairly simple, each one only needs a few things: A name, a description,
          some instructions, and finally, a list of actual things to guess. Let's use a list of Major League
          Baseball Teams as an example of a new game.
        </p>
        <p class='content'>
          After the name and description, we have to come up with some
          instructions. In this case, we probably don't want to include the city names of teams in the answers. It would
          take too long to guess all of the teams! So in the instructions, lets put something like 'Only team names
          count
          towards correct answers, not the city names'.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Next, we have to make a list of answers that the game will contain. Each answer has two parts: a
          display-answer,
          and an acceptable-answers list. Let's take a look at the St. Louis Cardinals. We have already established that
          we are not looking at the city name in the instructions. The display-answer is what the player will see when
          they answer correctly, or the game ends. In this case, the display-answer is going to be 'St. Louis
          Cardinals'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The acceptable-answers list contains up to three different answers that the game will look for as correct. For
          the St. Louis Cardinals, we might want to have an acceptable-answers list the looks something like this:
          cardinals, cards, red birds. If a player types in any of those during the game, it would count the St. Louis
          Cardinals as having been answered correctly. Don't worry about capitalization, we make everything lowercase
          behind the scenes. Do worry about spelling and punctuation. You can even take pity on players and include
          common
          spelling mistakes in the accepted-answers list if you want. It's totally up to you!
